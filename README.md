[FBPIC on GitHub](https://github.com/fbpic)

[FBPIC documentation](https://fbpic.github.io/)

***
Here is a [template notebook](https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-viewer/blob/master/opmd_viewer/notebook_starter/Template_notebook.ipynb) for using the OpenPMD GUI. Use this in the same directory as your FBPIC simulation notebook. That way, you can switch back and forth as needed for the interactive graphics.

For the [RadiaSoft JupyterHub server](https://jupyter.radiasoft.org), you should specify

    %matplotlib widget
    
in the first cell of the template notebook linked above.
